    educate, entertain and engage.  As new technologies continue to develop and allow
    individuals to connect and communicate efficiently like no other period in our
    history, the importance of video has risen astronomically. Thus, I strive to gather
    passionate teams together to collaborate and produce video projects that promote
    innovative ideas and push humanity forward.

  content: In today’s fast paced world, every frame matters as viewers have an overload of content competing for their      attention. With new technologies, the barriers to create video content has decreased. However, the importance of telling stories that advance humanity has never been greater. Through the medium of video, we intend to educate, entertain and motivate action.

  content: In our opinion, the role of media is to advance public discussion. Unfortunately, the current media landscape inconsistently stimulates an intellectual forum that leads to action towards socially responsible causes. Therefore, NewView.Media will produce video content that engages our audience to think about new views.
